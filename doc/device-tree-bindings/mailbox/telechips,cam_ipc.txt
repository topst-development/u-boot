Telechips camera IPC (Inter-*Processor* Communication) driver

In TCC805x, there is a ipc driver (a.k.a. cam_ipc) is used to communicate to MCU
firmware from AP (specifically sub-core). When Trust RVC is included in the MCU
firmware, it needs to be handled by IPC message to hand-over camera ownership.

Required properties:
- name : Should be cam_ipc
- compatible : Should be "telechips,cam_ipc"
- mboxes : The phandle of mailbox controller and the mailbox specifier. Mostly,
  in Telechips SDK, it should be <&micom_mbox_a53 id> since camera feature is
  handled by sub-core.

This node is a mailbox consumer. See the following files for details of
the mailbox subsystem, and the specifiers implemented by the relevant
provider(s):

- .../mailbox/mailbox.txt

Example:

	cam_ipc:cam_ipc {
		compatible = "telechips,cam_ipc";
		status = "okay";
		mboxes = <&micom_mbox_a53 0>;
	};
